/* Using the example data set from this chapter, compute the average age difference 
between mothers and children (the age of the mother when the child is born). You 
can use the average function defined earlier in this chapter.

Note that not all the mothers mentioned in the data are themselves present in the 
array. The byName object, which makes it easy to find a personâ€™s object from their 
name, might be useful here. */
