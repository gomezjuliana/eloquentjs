/*
Write a function arrayToList that builds up a data structure like 
the previous one when given [1, 2, 3] as argument, and write a 
listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Also write 
the helper functions prepend, which takes an element and a list and 
creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input 
list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element 
at the given position in the list, or undefined when there is no such 
element.

If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth.
